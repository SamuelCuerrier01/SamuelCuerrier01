## About Me

I'm currently a student at Cégep Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, working towards my goal of becoming a software engineer. I enjoy exploring different programming languages, building cool projects, and learning new things every day.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me dreaming about cars or tinkering with something new!
